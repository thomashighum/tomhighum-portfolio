## Description

This is a simple first draft of a portfolio page. Great practice of html and CSS, specifically flex-box. This will, when updated and implemented with more complex structures, be what I use for job search as a way to display and link to all of my different projects. I learned a lot making this, one thing was how valuable it is to make the Wireframe layouts beforehand (images of my desktop and mobile wireframe linked below). It was interesting really using Drawio and it was great for figuring out my flexbox layout and nesting. I also figured out a quite useful, for me, way to style css using variables that are easily changed. So that I can change the color and font schemes on the go. This project does feel a little lacking since I do not have any other projects to link so I linked some semi-random items and used undescriptive images.
In the future I would like to improve the asthetics, make the navbar dropdown project buttons reorder the "My Works" section. I would also like to see it made more responsive to the user.
